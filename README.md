# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures and Algorithms **(DSA)** is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think critically and solve complex problems systematically. Using the right data structure and algorithm can make your programs more efficient, especially when working with large datasets.

`Below is the Brief  about what we can learn in (DSA).`

## 1. Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

**Definition and Importance**:  
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Together, they are crucial in problem-solving, optimizing code efficiency, and enabling the handling of large amounts of data.

**Complexity Analysis**:  
- **Big O Notation**: Describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time, helping to understand its worst-case scenario.
- **Time Complexity**: Measures the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input.
- **Space Complexity**: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of its input.

## 2. Basic Data Structures

**Arrays**:  
- **Static Arrays**: Fixed-size arrays with elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Resizable arrays that can grow or shrink in size.
- **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Arrays of arrays, allowing for the representation of matrices and higher-dimensional data.

**Linked Lists**:  
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Each node points to the next, with the last node pointing to `nullptr`.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Nodes have pointers to both the next and the previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked Lists**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.

**Stacks**:  
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out) Structure**: Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.
- **Stack Operations**: Push (insert), pop (remove), peek (view top element).
- **Applications**: Function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking.

**Queues**:  
- **FIFO (First In, First Out) Structure**: Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- **Types of Queues**: Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue.
- **Operations**: Enqueue (insert), dequeue (remove), front (view front element).

**Strings**:  
- **Basic Operations**: Concatenation, substring extraction, pattern matching.
- **Pattern Matching Algorithms**: Naive algorithm, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Rabin-Karp.

## 3. Advanced Data Structures

**Trees**:
- **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children; used in hierarchical data representation.
  - **Traversals**: In-order, pre-order, and post-order methods for visiting nodes.
  - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary tree with ordered elements, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion.
  - **Balanced Trees**: Trees that maintain height balance to ensure operations remain efficient. Examples include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

- **Heaps**:  
  - **Binary Heaps**: A complete binary tree where each node is smaller (min-heap) or larger (max-heap) than its children.
  - **Heap Operations**: Insertion, deletion, and heapify. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues.

**Graphs**:
- **Representation**:  
  - **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array representing edge connections between vertices.
  - **Adjacency List**: A list where each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices.
  
- **Traversal Algorithms**:

  - **Prim’s Algorithm**: Greedily builds the MST by adding the shortest edge from the current tree.
  - **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Builds the MST by sorting all edges and adding the shortest edge without forming a cycle.

**Hash Tables**:  
- **Hash Functions**: Convert input into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically used to index into an array.
- **Collision Resolution Techniques**:  
  - **Chaining**: Each array index points to a linked list of elements that hash to the same index.
  - **Open Addressing**: Finds the next available slot in the array when a collision occurs.

## 4. Algorithm Design and Analysis

**Sorting Algorithms**:
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
- **Quicksort**: Selects a pivot and partitions the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger on the right.
- **Heap Sort**: Converts the array into a heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.

**Searching Algorithms**:
- **Linear Search**: Sequentially checks each element until the target is found.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Interpolation Search**: An improved variant of binary search that works well with uniformly distributed elements.

**Divide and Conquer**:
- **Basic Principles**: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their results.
- **Examples**: Merge sort, quicksort.

**Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
- **Concept**: Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant work.
