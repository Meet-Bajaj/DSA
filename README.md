# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.
Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

 Here’s a brief overview of what you would typically learn in a DSA course:
### 1. Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
**Definition and Importance**: Understanding what data structures and algorithms are and why they are crucial in problem-solving and efficient coding.
**Complexity Analysis**: Big O notation, time complexity, and space complexity.
### 2. Basic Data Structures
**Arrays**: Static arrays, dynamic arrays, multi-dimensional arrays.
**Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists.
**Stacks**: LIFO structure, stack operations (push, pop, peek), applications.
**Queues**: FIFO structure, types of queues (simple, circular, priority), operations.
**Strings**: Basic operations, pattern matching algorithms.
### 3. Advanced Data Structures
- **Trees**:
    - **Binary Trees**: Properties, traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
    - Binary Search Trees (BST): Insertion, deletion, search.
    - Balanced Trees: AVL trees, Red-Black trees.
    - **Heaps**: Binary heaps, heap operations, applications (priority queues).
- **Graphs**:
    - **Representation**: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
    - **Traversal Algorithms**: Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS).
